        <h1>Finding Your Ideal Drone</h1>
        <hr>
        <h2>Product Criteria</h2>
        <p>
            There are many key elements to choosing the drone that's best for you. Listed below are some of the key
            criteria worth considering when buying a drone. This is not an exhaustive list by any means, but it covers
            enough to get you started.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Cost
        </h3>
        <p>
            The biggest factor for most people is the cost. A drone can be an expensive purchase and finding the drone
            you need in the price range you want can be a daunting task. If you are a first time buyer and are a little
            intimidated by the technology then there are a lot of great options in the one-hundred dollar range or
            less. If you are looking at a drone for professional cinematic purposes the cost will reflect the decision,
            but even a decent quality drone can be found for a few hundred dollars.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Safety Features
        </h3>
        <p>
            Safety is, and should be, a concern for every drone flyer. Fortunately many modern drones have built in
            features to help keep both the drone and other objects safe.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Flight Time/Battery Life
        </h3>
        <p>
            Battery life (and corresponding flight time) can be easy to overlook, but should be a key factor when
            purchasing a drone. If you plan to fly your drone to a remote area to record you have to make sure you have
            enough battery life to get there, record, and get back. A 10 minute flight time quickly arrives.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Maximum Range
        </h3>
        <p>
            Somewhat related to the previous point is range. If you are just using a 2.4Ghz wifi connection from a
            phone for example you may only get a few hundred feet before your signal begins to degrade. Those expansive
            long range shots are impossible with some drones.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Stability
        </h3>
        <p>
            Stability in this regard refers to the ability to get clean and crisp images, and video. Drone stability in
            the air is only part of the consideration here. Drone stability is essential if the camera is fixed, but
            many modern drones use a gimbal to stablilize the camera. 3-axis gimbals will give the best results, but
            some drones only utilize a 2-axis gimbal and use software to stabilize the 3rd axis. The 2-axis gimbal
            drones are cheaper but they can still give remarkable shots.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Video/Photo Quality
        </h3>
        <p>
            Video quality is for the most part directly reflected in the price of the drone. However, there are several
            reasonably priced drones that can capture outstanding photos and video. The quality of these shots are more
            than enough for most users. There are a wide variety of drones that can record in 1080p and even 4k
            resolutions while maintaining a reasonable price point. Drones can also take photos up to 20MP which is
            rediculous by any standard.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you use editing software to enhance your recordings you can make the most of any video and photo. Even a
            novice, with decent editing software and a little research, can greatly enhance their overall product. This
            isn't really necessary for a lot of people, but if you really wanted to enhance the quality of the finished
            product it's worth mentioning.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Remote Control
        </h3>
        <p>
            Directly related to range is the remote control. Some drones can be flown with just your phone, but this
            usually limits range considerably. An external remote usually gives a much greater range while also giving
            an array of options to enhance the experience. Some remote controls come with a built-in video screen but
            most will connect to your phone for video feedback.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most remote controllers will use a wifi, or extended wifi signal to communicate with the drone. These
            extended signals can get up to a few kilometers of range if there is little interference. There are a few
            remote controllers that use proprietary systems that can even extend this range further.
        </p>
        <p>
            That said, you should never fly your drone out of sight so some of these controllers are a little overkill.
            But those proprietary systems tend to offer the best connections in areas that may experience some
            interference.
        </p>

        <h3>
            FPV Goggles
        </h3>
        <p>
            FPV goggles are a set of goggles (or in some cases glasses) that allow you to get a heads-up display right
            in front of you while you are flying. This gives an enhanced feedback to what exactly the drone is
            seeing/filming. Looking through the eyes of the drone can be a great experience but be aware that you will
            need a spotter to keep an eye on the drone (safety first!)
        </p>

        <h3>
            Noise
        </h3>
        <p>
            Most drones are not quiet! Looking at videos does not give an accurate reflection of the noise of a drone,
            and noise is definitely a factor many new buyers need to consider. If you plan to fly a drone in a populous
            area then noise is a consideration to account for. You don't want to be 'that guy' that disturbs everyone
            especially in a relaxing environment.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Size
        </h3>
        <p>
            Drone size is also a modern consideration when purchasing a drone. In the past, most drones were quite
            large, but today there are options. Some drones are small enough to fit in your pocket. And even some of
            the best video drones are portable enough to take everywhere. Size and weight is also a consideration in
            some countries where legislation may restrict the type of environment in which you can fly or even if you
            can take the drone in carry-on luggage at an airport.
        </p>

        <h3>
            App Features
        </h3>
        <p>
            App features can define your drone experience. A feature such as 'Return to Home' which brings your drone
            back to you if you press a button (or in some cases if you lose signal with the drone) is not only
            convenient but can turn a challenging experience such as finding a lost drone into relief as you see your
            drone coming back to you.
        </p>
        <p>
            App features come with safety in mind but also much more. Some apps can allow you to set 'Follow Mode' to
            allow your drone to follow you as it records; 'Orbit Mode' allowing the drone to pan around you; and 'Sport
            Mode' to record at high speed. But these are just a few of the many options available.
